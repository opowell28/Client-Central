# Client-Central
A patient portal developed as part of the SWENG 411 curriculum. 

This software will provide secure and convenient access to medical
records for patients, doctors, and caretakers. The software will
benefit patients because they will have the ability to access
their medical information from most devices and receive things
such as prescription updates and appointment notifications. 
Doctors will be able to provide updates through the software and
get information to their patients (and caretakers) quickly. 
Caretakers will be able to have access to the information without
fraud concerns because they will have to be given access by the
primary physician.
